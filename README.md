# Worst-Case Soft Actor-Critic (WCSAC) for Safety-Constrained Reinforcement Learning: A PyTorch Implementation

This is a PyTorch implementation of Worst-Case Soft Actor-Critic (WCSAC) [[Page]](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17272) [[PDF]](https://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/mtjspaan/pub/Yang21aaai.pdf). You can find the official TensorFlow implementation of WCSAC [here](https://github.com/AlgTUDelft/WCSAC). 

This repository is built around [PyTorch SAC](https://github.com/denisyarats/pytorch_sac) by Denis Yarats and Ilya Kostrikov.

## Requirements
We assume you have access to a GPU that can run `CUDA 11.2`. We also assume that you have Safety-Gym ([GitHub](https://github.com/openai/safety-gym), [Blog](https://openai.com/blog/safety-gym/)) and Mujoco-Py 2.0.2.7 installed. 
```
conda env create -f conda_env.yml
source activate pytorch_wcsac
```
<sub>Note: Please do not raise any issues for problems related to Safety-Gym or Mujoco-Py installation.</sup>

## Instructions
To train a WCSAC-0.1 agent on the `Safexp-PointGoal1-v0` environment from Safety-Gym run:
```
python train.py env=point_goal_1 risk_level=0.1 seed=123
```
This will produce `exp` folder, where all the outputs are going to be stored including train/eval logs, tensorboard blobs, and evaluation episode videos. One can attach tensorboard to monitor training by running:
```
tensorboard --logdir exp
```
Also, see `config/agent/wcsac.yaml` for full list of hyperparameters. Note that `env` should have this format: `{Robot}_{Goal}_{Level-of-Difficulty}`.
